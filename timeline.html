          <p class="description">In 1991, Linus Torvalds used the GNU tools to produce a new kernel which was a good alternative to the UNIX kernel: Linux. This kernel was a good match for the GNU project as it was also open-source and free to use. As a result, it was integrated into the GNU project and the GNU programs were ported to run on it. The resulting operating system was called GNU/Linux. Today, the majority of supercomputers and servers running the Internet still run on some form of GNU/Linux.</p>
